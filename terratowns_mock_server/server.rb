# ActiveModel in Ruby on Rails
#ActiveModel, a component of Ruby on Rails, functions as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool and contains a validation module. The Terratowns production server, built on Rails, employs these validations, which are often identical to those used here.

#For more information:
# - [ActiveModel Basics](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html)
# - [ActiveRecord Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

  # create some virtual attributes to stored on this object
  # This will set a getter and setter
  # eg. 
  # home = new Home()
  # home.town = 'hello' # setter
  # home.town() # getter
  attr_accessor :town, :name, :description, :domain_name, :content_version

  validates :town, presence: true, inclusion: { in: [
    'melomaniac-mansion',
    'cooker-cove',
    'video-valley',
    'the-nomad-pad',

  ] }
